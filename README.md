# Polynomial-Regression
Polynomial Regression in Python with Scikit Learn

This is one of the most used regression technique used over the internent, where we use Polynomial Regression to narrow down on basis of coefficients which channel  for advertising is least effective.

This process i have incorporated in my day to day work / project where by i used the same knowledge to train and predict sales. Polynomial Regression provides better RMSE score then the simple linear regression model and its even easier to interpret and explain. 

The data set is from kaggle, however for my project i used company's data
